## TL;DR

I know you are busy, so here's the TL;DR version:
Burokku is an all-in-one Web3 dashboard, it's a Web3 search engine, a Web3 information aggregator, a Web3 portfolio tracker, and more. We will be launching soon, join the
Waitlist [here](https://burokku.one) now.

## Burokku what?

Today, we are launching **Burokku** ("block" in Japanese), an all-in-one Web3 Dashboard. Although we are still in development,
we are excited to share our vision with you, and we hope you will join us on this journey.

First of all, you can join the Waitlist [here](https://burokku.one) right now, just click on the big button that says "Join Waitlist", connect your wallet and
put in your email address optionally, and you will be added to the waitlist. You will be the first to know when we launch, and those who join the waitlist won't be
disappointed for sure when we launch.

## What can this do?

### It's an all-in-one Web3 Dashboard

**Burokku** is an all-in-one Web3 Dashboard that's super customizable, it provides you with many super cool widgets that you can add to your own dashboard. Although we are
still in development, you can already get a feel of it by visiting our main website [here](https://burokku.one), you will find a simplified version of the dashboard.

Give that a shot! Drag the sample widget from the sidebar and drop it on the dashboard on the right, try to move things around, resize, and more! You can already feel the flexibility
of the dashboard that is so much different from other dashboards out there.

### It's a Web3 Search Engine

Its build-in search engine allows you to search for anything Web3 related, from wallet activities, and tokens, to NFTs, to dApps, articles, Web3 real-time feed and more.
What's cool is that this has first-class command support, just hit `Ctrl + K` (or `Cmd + K` on Mac) and start typing, you will be able to search for anything you want!

## Why do I need this?

Well, you don't really need this, but as a Web3 degen myself, I find myself constantly switching between different dApps/websites every day, and I find it really annoying to
have to switch between different tabs, and I also find it annoying that I have to use different dApps for different things. What's more, I find it really hard to consume Web3
related content too, X (Twitter) is my main source of the latest Web3 things, but it can sometimes be really hard to find the right content, and I find myself constantly scrolling
through my feed to find the right content. Discord and Telegram are also great sources of Web3 content, but you will have to be in the right group to get the right content. I also
subscribed to a few newsletters, but I find myself not reading them at all after a few days.

What if there's a dashboard that can do all of these things in one place? That's why we are building **Burokku**. We want to build a dashboard that can do all of these things and more.
It supports more than 15 different blockchains, and many Web3 flatforms/protocols (e.g. Lens Protocol etc.).

## What's next?

We are still in development, and we are working hard to get this out as soon as possible. But we can't wait to share our vision with you, and we hope you will join us on this journey.
You can join the Waitlist [here](https://burokku.one) right now, just click on the big button that says "Join Waitlist", connect your wallet and put in your email address optionally.
